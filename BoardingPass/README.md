Omega Boarding Pass

This project is meant to emulate the function of a kiosk located in the ATL airport. 
Taking a passenger's personal details and flight information, the program calculates and saves 
an ETA, price, and unique boarding pass number. A boarding pass is then generated and stored in a file for 
the passenger.
